# Local Development

## First-time setup

From the monorepo root, install both app dependencies and seed the local demo:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

This creates the ignored `apps/frontend/.env.local` and `apps/bff/local-data/`
paths.

## Choose the component you are developing

### BFF

Start everything except the BFF:

```bash
make -C apps/bff support-bff
```

This starts the Frontend and prepares seeded pipeline data. Run the BFF separately from your terminal, IDE, or debugger:

```bash
make -C apps/bff bff-local
```

### Frontend

Start everything except the Frontend:

```bash
make -C apps/bff support-frontend
```

This starts the BFF and prepares seeded pipeline data. Run the Frontend separately from your terminal or debugger:

```bash
make -C apps/bff frontend-local
```

### Pipeline

Start everything except the Pipeline:

```bash
make -C apps/bff support-pipeline
```

This starts the BFF and Frontend. Run Pipeline tests separately:

```bash
make -C apps/bff pipeline-test
```

Run the full Synto pipeline only when provider-backed execution is needed:

```bash
LLM_API_KEY=... make -C apps/bff pipeline-run
```

## Run the normal app

If you are not isolating one component:

```bash
make local-start
```

## Ports

Defaults:

```text
BFF_PORT=8080
AUTH_PORT=8081
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
```

Override them on any Make target:

```bash
make local-start BFF_PORT=18080 FRONTEND_PORT=13000
```

The generated Frontend `.env.local` automatically uses `BFF_PORT`.

## URLs

```text
Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:3000
BFF:      http://127.0.0.1:8080
Auth:     http://127.0.0.1:8081
```

## Local authentication

Local mode provides one admin-capable demo account:

```text
email:    demo@llm-wiki.dev
password: demo123456
user ID:  local-user
role:     admin
```

Get a fresh 15-minute JWT from the running Auth service:

```bash
TOKEN="$(make -C apps/bff local-token)"
```

Use it for normal or admin APIs:

```bash
curl -fsS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/admin/settings
```

When overriding the Auth port:

```bash
TOKEN="$(make -C apps/bff local-token AUTH_PORT=18081)"
```

The credential and `JWT_SECRET=dev-secret` are local-only. Do not use them for deployed environments, and do not commit a generated JWT.

Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the support processes.

If local processes were orphaned, stop every listener on the configured local ports:

```bash
make local-stop
```

For overridden ports:

```bash
make local-stop BFF_PORT=18080 AUTH_PORT=18081 FRONTEND_PORT=13000
```

## Generated local config

`make bootstrap` creates `apps/frontend/.env.local`:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8081
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_ID=local-user
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_PROJECT_ID=demo
```

The Makefile supplies the BFF and Auth local environments automatically. Reset demo data with:

```bash
make seed
```
